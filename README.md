my_linux_scripts
================

This is a list of the shell scripts and other files that I use on a regular basis or have found useful in linux/cygwin.
As well as several samples I keep around for reference.


Feel free to use any of the examples I have listed. 
Please submit and issue if something doesn't work for you, or if you are trying to do something specific and need help.
I welcome any feedback you have to impart.
I am happy to try and create a solution to your issue.
