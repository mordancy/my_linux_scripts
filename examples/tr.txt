tr translates or replaces values

Here is a way to remove repeating single quote characters from a file and replace them with an individual sigle quote (or other charachter of your choosing)

tr -s \' <  input_file.csv  > output_file.txt
|   | |  |  |____________|  | |_____________|
|   | |  |        |         |        |
|   | |  |        |         |        \____ Output file name
|   | |  |        |         |
|   | |  |        |         \____ redirect to a file
|   | |  |        |                  
|   | |  |        \____ Input file name
|   | |  |
|   | |  \____ redirect from a file
|   | |
|   | \____ input sequence (use backslash when searching for special charachters like single quote)
|   |
|   \____ --squeeze-repeats: replaces each input sequence of a repeated character that is listed with a single occurrence of that character
|
\____ translate or delete characters


Note after the input sequence value you can use another character to compress the repeats into
examples:
1) example: to remove repeated single quotes and replace them with a colon type:
   tr -s \' : < input_file.csv  > output_file.txt
2) to remove repeated single quotes and replace them with a pipe type (notice the backslash in front of the special character pipe):
   tr -s \' \| < input_file.csv  > output_file.txt
