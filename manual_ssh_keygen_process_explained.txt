Steps:
1) create your local key and make it read/write for yourself. This should only have to be done once for your local system
ssh-keygen -t dsa
chmod 600 .ssh/id_dsa

2) copy the key to the server. You will be prompted for your password.
scp .ssh/id_dsa.pub <USERID>@<SERVER>:

3) copy the file to auth keys and set ssh folder to read/write/execute. You should be prompted for your password
ssh <USERID>@<SERVER>
cat id_dsa.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 700 .ssh

4) remove the file you uploaded
rm -i id_dsa.pub

5) exit the server and test your ssh connection (no password should be required this time).
exit
ssh <USERID>@<SERVER>
